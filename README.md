## Types of Recommendation Engines

There are primarily three types of recommendation engines:

1. **Popularity-based**
2. **Content-based**
3. **Collaborative filtering-based**

### Popularity-based Recommendation Engine

- Simplest form of recommendation
- Examples: Trending lists on YouTube or Netflix
- Tracks view counts and ranks movies accordingly
- Effective despite its simplicity

### Content-based Recommendation Engine

- Analyzes movie contents (storyline, genre, cast, director, etc.)
- Finds similar movies based on content analysis
- Ranks and recommends movies based on similarity scores

### Collaborative Filtering-based Recommendation Engine

- Finds similar users based on activities and preferences
- Recommends movies liked by similar users
- Example: Amazon's "Customers who viewed this item also viewed" feature
